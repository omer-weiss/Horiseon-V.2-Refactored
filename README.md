## Description

- My goal in working on the code of this website was to change code to make it more accessible from a user standpoint and also more readable from a devoloper standpoint. This process involved learning how to make html elements more semantic, giving access to alts for images, therefore letting screen readers describe content easier to blind users, fixing elements to follow a more concise page structure, fixing broken links to make the page more dynamic and changing the title of the web page to be more descriptive. The work I did on this website also enabled me to practice good work flow and learn how to use proper git conventions.


## Installation

I created a new repo on github and pushed exisiting website html/css code to it. I then opened the code on vscode and began the process of adjusting code to make it more accessible to users and readable to developers. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
